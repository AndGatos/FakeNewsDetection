There are notebooks in the directories "stemming" and "lemmatization" where the appropriate text preprocessing has already been implemented.

Thes CSV files are then loaded to the notebooks "stem_mlp.ipynb" and "lemma_mlp.ipynb" in order to train the Multilayer Perceptron either with the Average Word2Vec method or TFIDF Average Word2Vec method.
